Building MLPClassifier from Scratch

This notebook, MLPScratch.ipynb, explores the implementation and usage of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) from scratch.

Contents
Load Dataset

In this section, the necessary dataset is loaded for the experiments.

Applying MLPClassifier

One layer: Implementation and results with an MLP having a single layer.
Trying out 3 layers: Experiments with an MLP architecture having three layers.

Attempt 1

The first attempt at refining or tweaking the model for better performance and building the model from Scratch.
